Hi! Anything you put next to this (that is, directly in the sources folder) won't be found by the m12NameGenerator. Instead, create a subfolder for your own use, such as your username, project name, etc. For more information about adding your own names, refer to READ_ME.md

A note on conventions in the m12_defaults: as a rule, proper nouns are capitalized, while most things in the "descriptors" folder are lowercase. Be aware of this if you are not using m12_name_generator's create_compound_name() function, which will capitalize its output for you
